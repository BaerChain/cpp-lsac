                          INSTALLING MPIR
                          =================


These instructions are only for the impatient.  Others should read the install
instructions in mpir.info.  Use

	info -f ./mpir.info

or in emacs

	C-u C-h i mpir.info


Here are some brief instructions on how to install MPIR, and some examples to
help you get started using it.  First you need to compile.  Since you're
impatient, try this

	./configure
	make
	make check		<= VERY IMPORTANT!!

If that fails, or you care about the performance of MPIR, you need to read the
full instructions in the chapter "Installing MPIR" in the manual.

You should not skip the "make check" part; the risk that the MPIR sources are
miscompiled are unfortunately quite high.  And if they indeed are, "make check"
is very likely to trigger the compiler-introduced bug.

Optionally, you can install the library with the following command.  This will
be to /usr/local by default, and you'll probably need to be "root" to be able
to write there.

	make install

To create the printable documentation from the texinfo source, type "make
mpir.dvi" or "make mpir.ps".  This requires various "tex" commands.

If you are new to MPIR, it is a good idea you at least read the chapter "MPIR
Basics" in the manual.

Some known build problems are noted in the "Installing MPIR" chapter of
the manual.  Please report other problems to http://groups.google.co.uk/group/mpir-devel/.
